DAY 2 of

## Coding-Self-Challenge

# üå§Ô∏è What's the Weather Today? 

Time taken: 60 minutes

Level: Intermediate

Tutorial from: https://www.codedex.io/projects/create-a-to-do-list-app-with-html-css-js

I got excited because I am intending to do a project on Google Maps clone soon and this project is a perfect foundation to know a thing or two about APIs interaction. I changed a few things to make the website more pretty, fixing some codings here and there because the tutorial this time is not 100% correct. That part took me the most time but other than that, I found myself easily follow the tutorials and finishing it up in less than an hour!
